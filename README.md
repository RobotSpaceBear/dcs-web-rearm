# dcs-web-rearm

This is an Vue.js project I'm using to learn Vue.js.

I'm trying to make a loadout configurator for DCS World where you can simulate loadouts in a web app. It will probably look very much like the ingame rearm/refuel screen where you are able to add weapons to pylons and have a weight calculator to help you preapre for different missions "on the go".

This project will have :

* a lot of errors,
* mistakes,
* and anti-patterns as I'm transitioning from backend and desktop apps to web apps.
I'm more of a desktop client guy, at heart. But I'm trying.

The whole idea behind this app is to have functionality like you'd see on WoW Armory or the fantastic https://coriolis.io/ for Elite : Dangerous. Basically, a theory crafting tool.
